# Variables

# What is a program?

* A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.

* A program has two elements:
  * **Data**: Information such as facts, measurements, or observations.
  * **Instructions**: Steps that specify how to manipulate the data.

---

# What is a variable?

* A variable is a name that stores the **Data**.
* It serves as a reference to the data stored in memory.
* For example in
    ```python
    age = 15
    ```
    is *age* the variable name and *15* the data stored in memory.

# Variable Declaration

* In Python, you can declare a variable and assign a value to it in a single line.
* The value determines the type of the variable.
* That is unlike other languages where you have to declare the type of the variable.

---

# Multiple variable assignment

* It is possible to assign multiple variables in a single line.
* For example:
    ```python
    a, b, c = 5, 3.2, "Hello"
    ```
